# TORCH | SPOT THAT FIRE!

## Challenge: Build a crowdsourcing tool for citizens to contribute to early detection, verification, tracking, visualization, and notification of wildfires. Torch is a high-impact, creative, innovative, scientific, responsive, user friendly solution that will help many people by improving the data set for fires and improving the response time. 

## Core Features
1. early detection (near real time 3-5 min)
2. Verification: other crowdsourced data (3-5 min), drone (30 minutes), satellite imagery (3-4 hours after), 
3. Tracking: time stamp, knowing position of the fire as a function of time
4. Visualization: single page map application of coordinates
5. notification of wildfires: email, Twitter, SMS, app notification on phone based on location
6. Distance of notification/applicability
7. Frequency of notification: asap, summary of a day
## Stretch Features
1. Voice processing and gathering of incoming data
2. Tweets?
3. Images added to fire data set
4. Prediction via weather status
